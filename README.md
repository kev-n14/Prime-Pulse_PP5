## Security Features and Defensive Design
### User Authentication
- Users must provide full name email address when creating an account
- User is verified by email address.
- django default admin page has a path way of admin/. we changed this to a different path. By use honeypot a dumby admin site is created.
- all sensitive information is stored in a env.py file.

### Form Validation
- CSRF tokens prevent CSRF because without a token, an attacker cannot create valid requests to the backend server. For the Synchronised Token Pattern, CSRF tokens should not be transmitted using cookies. The CSRF token can be transmitted to the client as part of a response payload, such as a HTML or JSON response.

### Database Security

- Secure Connection (SSL/TLS):

- Configure your application to connect to ElephantSQL using a secure SSL/TLS connection. This helps encrypt data transmitted between your application and the database server, protecting it from interception.
Strong Authentication:

- Use strong and unique credentials (username and password) for accessing your ElephantSQL database.
Avoid using default or easily guessable credentials.
Regularly rotate your database credentials to maintain security.
